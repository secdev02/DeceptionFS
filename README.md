Using Projected File System, we can do in User Mode, what we normally need a filter driver for.

This repo is designed for 2 things. 

1. To show an example of Deception File System based on Canarytokens.

2. Show some of the primitives for building your own providers


To get started you only need Windows Notepad.

Create your Canarytoken at
